1. run configure in the main indri directory. Provide
   --with-site-seed=hostname to specify the host to use as a
   seed. Alternatively, after running configure, manually edit the file
   seeds.txt, inserting one hostname per line. configure will create the
   files site-search/build.param, site-search/crawl-index, and
   site-search/seeds.txt. Manually edit the file
   site-search/excluded_hosts to give the urls of any hosts to exclude
   from the crawl. You must include the http:/ prefix on the hostnames.

2. Run make in the indri source tree (if necessary).

3. The script crawl-index will create a directory named crawl within the
   site-search subdirectory of the indri source tree. The location to
   build in will become a parameter later. The script will then run
   heritrix in the crawl subdirectory, placing the trecweb format data
   files in the corpus subdirectory. When the crawler has finished,
   harvestlinks will run over the files in corpus, generating inlink
   data in the linkz subdirectory. When harvestlinks has finished,
   buildindex will run, using the build.param file and default
   stopwords. The output index with be placed in crawl/index/crawl. The
   script will chmod the index to be world readable. The index can be
   moved before use.

4. php ui components

If configured with --enable-php, the PHP library will be installed in
${exec_prefix}/lib/libindri_php.so.  Install this library somewhere that
PHP can find it. You may need to talk to your system administrator to 
figure this out.

The PHP files will be installed in ${prefix}/share/php. Copy the
contents of this directory to somewhere that your webserver can find
them. Edit the include/config.php file according to the comments in it
to set the path to your index, sitename, and document format.

The heritrix crawler (http://crawler.archive.org) has been modified to
include the TrecWebWriterProcessor to emit trecweb formatted
documents. Full documentation/source, available via the website.

5. cgi ui components

The CGI files will be installed in ${prefix}/share/cgi. Copy the
contents of this folder to the location accessible via your
webserver. Be sure that your webserver configuration will allow
executables to be run. Consult your webserver documentation or system
administator if you are uncertain how to ensure this.

Before the initial execution, edit the "lemur.config" file (which should stay
in the same directory as lemur.cgi) to reflect your configuration. 

See the ${prefix}/share/cgi/lemur.config file for an example configuration.

The configuration file is a well-formed XML file with the opening tag
<lemurconfig>. There are two required elements within the configuration file:

<templatepath>: this should reflect the path (either relative or absolute) to
                the template files.

<indexes>: this section contains information about what indexes are available,
           and can contain as many indexes as needed. For each <index> item,
           there should be two elements. First, a <path> element must be set
           pointing at where the index is located. Secondly (and optionally),
           a <description> tag can be set to be a description of the pointed
           index. The path should be the full path to the index
           constructed by the crawl-index script.
           
There is also an optional element <rootpaths> that defines if the original
path in the search result exists, then to strip it out of the URL. This is
most useful for enabling a site-search capability where there are locally 
mirrored versions of the indexed web pages. For example, if your local cache
of your website is at "/var/cache/mirrored_site/", if you do not have the
LemurCGI set to strip paths, the original URLs displayed would include the
prefix "/var/cache/mirrored_site/" in front of every result. This option
is not necessary for indexes built with the crawl-index script.

Also, there is an element, <supportanchortext> that can be set to true to
also include support for retrieval of inlinks if you have used the 
harvestlinks program to gather these from your corpus. This is the
default setting for indexes built with crawl-index.

Edit the file help-db.html to describe the contents of the text
database(s) being searched by the Lemur search engine.  You can describe
the documents in whatever way you feel is most helpful to your users.

If you wish to use the default HTML templates, no modifications are
necessary, but if you want to modify the HTML templates for your own uses,
be sure to read the "README_Templates.txt" file for instructions on
available commands that you can use within the templates.
